      <h3> About Corona </h3><br><br>
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>
<br>
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br> Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
